#UPWELING IN SOUTHWEST COAST OF INDIA-INTERANNUAL VARIABILITY
#STUDY AREA -south west coast of India
#AIM-To plot the sst of 15 years (2003-2006)
#sst datas are downloaded from https://coastwatch.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap
#datas used are Multi-scale Ultra-high Resolution (MUR) SST Analysis fv04.1, Global, 0.01Â°, 2002-present,Daily
#datas 2003-01-01T09:00:00Z 2016-12-31T09:00:00Z,stride=10 with LONG=(70E-79E) AND LONG=(3N-17N)
#dowloaded datas for each year separately and the datas in the file is called sst in .nc format
#enter the raster library for raster datas
